Creating Market Equilibrium graphs with Python
* The [notebook](https://github.com/emdhng/MicroeconomicsProject/blob/main/microeconomics_project_parts_1_and_2.ipynb) contains the answers to the quiz I made on Market Equilibrium as parts of a project in my Microeconomics class.
* I used Python to create Market Equilibrium graphs as there weren't any free and readily available Economics graph makers that could give plenty of room for customization compared to making use of the libraries Matplotlib, pandas, and NumPy with Python.
